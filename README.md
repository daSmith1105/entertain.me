*Finding local events is easy with Entertain.Me. Food, Music, Family events, and more at the click of a button. Let's do something!*

## Purpose

The app was created to provide a simple interface to browse local events. It interfaces with the eventful.com web API.

## How to works:

The user inputs their State, city, or zipcode (if the app cannot determine their current location automatically) in the location bar. Then they select an event type from the dropdown list. Providing a keyword to search is optional.
After selecting the "Let's Do Something!" button, results will populate the screen with navigation for returning to the initial search page, navigating additional pages, and an area to search a different location in the current category.
The category can be changed at any time using the navigation in the upper left corner of the screen as well
